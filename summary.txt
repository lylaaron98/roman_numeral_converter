Summary Documentation: Roman to Arabic Converter
Overview
The Roman to Arabic Converter is a web application that allows users to convert Roman numerals to their corresponding Arabic numeral representations. It consists of a backend built using Node.js and an API that performs the conversion, as well as a frontend created using React for user interaction.

Development Process
Backend Development
* 		Setting Up the Backend
    * Initialize a Node.js project.
    * Install the required dependencies, including Express and CORS.
    * Set up the Express server to handle requests and responses.
    * Implement the conversion logic for converting Roman numerals to Arabic numerals.
    * Handle error cases and respond appropriately.
* 		Building the API
    * Create an endpoint that accepts a Roman numeral as a query parameter.
    * Perform error handling for invalid or missing input.
    * Use the 'roman-numerals' library to handle the conversion process.
    * Return the converted Arabic numeral or an error message based on the input.
Frontend Development
* 		Setting Up the Frontend
    * Create a new React application.
    * Design the user interface with input fields for Roman numerals and a Convert button.
    * Implement state management for the input and output fields.
* 		Fetching Data from the Backend
    * Create a function to handle fetching data from the backend API.
    * Handle response data and errors appropriately.

    * Apply CSS styling to improve the visual appeal of the application.
    * Customize the appearance of input fields, buttons, and result displays.
Deployment and Testing
* 		Deployment
    * Deploy the backend and frontend applications to hosting platforms.
    * Ensure that the server is accessible and the frontend interacts correctly with the backend.
* 		Testing and Debugging
    * Test the application for various use cases and edge cases.
    * Debug and resolve any issues related to data conversion, network requests, or user interface rendering.
